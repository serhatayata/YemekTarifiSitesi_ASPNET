In this page I have used ASP.NET framework and C#.

There are many options you can use, some of them are;
- Dish of the day
- Offer a recipe
- Make a comment for recipes
and more...

There is also an administrator panel. You must use your admin name and password to enter that panel.
In that panel, there are also some properties you can use, some of them;
- You can add new categories
- Verify the comments for them to be shown.
- You can also verify the recipes offered by users
and some other properties.
